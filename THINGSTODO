novanet_courses

- one program has many novanet_courses
- novanet_course_programs middle
- one novanet_course has many program
- program_id
- class_name
- registered_on_pearson
- modules completed
- comments (how they're doing)
- novanet reports? should we have all the columns that are in reports?

Sarah:
- form layouts
- home pages of users (designing)
- help button on index
- mass adding (do search and checkbox menu type thing)
- design suggestions for the website
- non-maximized window resizing of content
- also, jessie wanted the option of "unknown" in dropdown boxes, so if you could replace the null options or options that are arrays with a second element of '0' with 'Unknown' that would be helpful. 
(I don't want to change it on mine and then copy paste over it with yours, which does not have this feature.) 

Thank :D

QUESTION:
SUGGESTION OF ORGANIZATION OF PHONE CALLS

* add program enrollment ( list of people, check boxes, submit once )
* Novanet [separate from programs]

* Phone Call classes


X (sort of.) list of all enrolled students in the program 
a specific students' attendance
if student misses a day, automatically create phone call

Yada:

authentication (multiple type of accounts)
parent needs separate search


hotlink everything
Mass Data Editing (select_all) javascript
set types for events (talk to rachel & jessie)
total credit for students under student index

Excel Import

Novanet Report import

ONLY FOR THE AESTHETICS

- /people
> the types should have the checkboxes next to name or closer or something idk
> first name, last name positioning of text fields
> format order of date better :I
